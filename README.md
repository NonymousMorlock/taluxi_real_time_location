# A Real-time location manager for [Taluxi](https://github.com/sitatec/Taluxi-Open-Source)

This package manages all location-related features, it deals with the os to get one shot location or location stream. The client of the [DriverLocationManager](https://github.com/sitatec/Taluxi-Open-Source/tree/main/backend/driver_location_manager) microservice is implemented in this repository. It uses Firebase real-time database for the location traking and the DriverLocationManager as a repository for all connected driver locations. The Driver location is sent to the DriverLocationManager Every 1KM so when a client is looking for a taxi the result will be based on the most recent driver locations (1KM is a little bit long but it reduces the battery consumption and the server bandwidth), It will stop sending the location when the driver starts driving a client and will continue when the driver will be available again.
